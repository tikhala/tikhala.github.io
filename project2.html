            <p>A Data-Driven Insights Dashboard developed for Human Resource Department. This project is an analysis of relevant personnel data, displayed to help see trends, patterns, and areas that need work.<br><br>

            Employee data: 22,000 rows of data from the year 2000 to 2020. First the data was loaded into MySQL Database, and worked on using MySQL Workbench. The questions of the analysis were answered by generating SQL Queries, exported as tables and visualized using Microsoft Power BI.<br><br> <strong>The data cleaning SQL script:</strong>

                <p><strong>Summary of Findings</strong><ol>
                    <li>There are more male employees compared to females.</li>
                    <li>White race is the most dominant while Native Hawaians and American Indians are the least dominant.
                    </li>
                    <li>The youngest employee is 20 years old and the oldest is 59 years old.</li>
                    <li>Age bins were created for the analaysis (18-24,25-34,35-44,45-54,55-64). The age bin 25-34 has the largest number of employees, followed by 35-44, while the smallest group was 55-64 age bin.
                    </li>
                    <li>A majority of employees work at the headquaters compared to the number of employees who work remotely.</li>
                    <li>The average tenure in this company is 7 years.
                    </li>
                    <li>The gender distribution across departments is fairly balanced, but there are generally more males compared to the number of females in eact department.</li>
                    <li>The marketing department has the highest turnover rate, followed by Training Department. The least turnover rate are thr REsearch and Development, Support and Legal Departments.</li>
                    <li>A large number of employees come from the state of Ohio.
                    </li>
                    <li>The net change in employees has increased over the years.</li>
                    <li>The average tenure for each department is about 8 years, with the Legal and Auditing Departments having the highest. Services, Sales and MArketing Departments have the lowest tenure at department level.</li>
                </ol>
    
                        <br><strong>Limitations</strong><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Some records (967) were dropped after makingt the assumption that the legal working age was 18 years old. It is to be noted that the 967 dropped rows also contained some negative values, (Age column generated from the difference of Birthdate and Current date), which meant there were errors in date values of some rows.</li>
                            <li>Some termination dates were too far off into the future, and therefore were not included in the analysis (1599 rows). The only termination dates used were those less than or equal to the current date.</li>
                            <li>The gender value: Unclassified, may have altered the gender distribution because some males or females may have chosen not to state thier gender thereby altering the true gender distribution of the data.</li>
