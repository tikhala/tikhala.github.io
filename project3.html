                <h2>What App Should I Develop?</h2>
            </header>
            <p>An insight into what app to develop using app data from the apple store. For a young app developer looking to break into a profitable app category.<br><br>

            <b>The Stakeholder</b> <br><br>In this case, our stakeholder is an aspiring app developer who needs data driven insight to decide what app to develop. Seeking answers to questions like: What app categories are most popular? What price should I set for my app? How can i maximize my user ratings?
                <br><br><strong>Data Context</strong><br><br>
            The dataset included information covering the apps available on the appstore, dataset from Kaggle.com. One dataset called applestore which included app details of pps available on the appstore: Appnames, Sizing Bytes, Ratings, Supporting Device, Number of supported Languages and more. <br><br>One other dataset for the apps description, which explains how the app interfaces with its userbase and what solution it provides, and a glimpse of how it might be perceived on the market. The columns included app unique identity, size in bytes, description and more.<br><br>

            <br><br><strong>Connecting to the Dataset</strong><br><br>
            Using SQL-Lite online allows for a seamless online connection to a dataset without the need to install dependencies, and setting up database on a local machine.

            <br><br><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</strong><br><br>
            The dataset was combined from four separate tables, because SQL-LIte online does not take in large datasets. The four were combined into one dataset using *Union All* an SQL function that one unified data table from multiple tables.<br><br>Exploring the data to reveal issues in data inconsistencies, data errors and outliers before perfoming the actual data analysis.

            <p><strong>Recomendations from the Analysis</strong><br>
                 <ol>
                    <li><b>Paid versus free apps:</b> Paid apps generally achieve slightly higher ratings than free apps, users who pay for an app may perceive the app more valuable and so are much more likely to engange in rating.</li>
                    <li><b>Language support:</b>Apps that support more than 10 languages but less than 30 languages have better ratings compared to those that support more that 30 languages and those that support less than 10 languages.</li>
                    <li><b>High perfoming genres:</b>Categories like Finace and Books have existing apps that have a very low user ratings indicating an opportunity gap for app development as a result of user needs not being fully met.</li>
                    <li><b>App description length:</b>A detailed, well crafted app description is essential for the success of an app as the length of the app's descritpion sets clear expectation from the user. From the data exploration, the length of the description is directly correlated with higher user app ratings.</li>
                    <li>The average rating of apps on the appstore is 3.5, and the highest rating is 5. To stand out from the crowd, developer needs to aim for a rating higher than the average user rating.</li>
                    <li>Games, with 3862 apps, Seconded by Entertainment with 535 apps, and Education with 453 apps suggest that these three top genres are saturated and therefore showing high competition on the development side of things. This however also indicate a high user demand in these genres.</li>
